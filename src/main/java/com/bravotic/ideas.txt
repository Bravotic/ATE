Ideas:

* Scrolling at different parts of the screen makes the view scroll more (like in plan9)

* Add a way to let the state propmpt the user. Should probably be implemented with a callback so something can be done
with that information later.

* Remove the need for a menu item to return true/false to keep the menu open or closed. Should always close the menu
when selected in my eyes. Might revert later, or make a special (nonClosingMenuAction) or something. That's the proper
OOP way to do this lol.
